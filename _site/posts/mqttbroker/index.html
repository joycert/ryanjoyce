<p>I go into this problem more in the README for this Github project (<a href="https://github.com/joycert/light_listener">light_listener</a>) but the TLDR is that it's really hard to send data from the cloud to an edge device. Your wifi router does a wonderful job protecting anything in your home from outside attack, and unless you want to go into it and mess with some config stuff that means you can't just &quot;send&quot; data to anything unless it asks for it.</p>
<p>The most reasonable solution here is to use the <a href="ryanjoyce.me">MQTT</a> protocol. This way, your device always has a lightweight connection to your &quot;broker&quot; in the cloud that will relay any information to your device you'd like it to.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need" tabindex="-1">What you need</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="ryanjoyce.me/ectwosetup">An AWS EC2 instance</a></li>
<li>Homebrew (on mac)</li>
<li>Mosquitto installed locally</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-do-it" tabindex="-1">How to do it</h2>
<h3 id="1.-ssh-into-your-ec2-instance" tabindex="-1">1. SSH into your EC2 instance</h3>
<h3 id="2.-install%2C-enable%2C-and-start-mosquitto" tabindex="-1">2. Install, enable, and start Mosquitto</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
</code></pre>
<p>You can just copy and paste this into your terminal then hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of code block:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get a list of package updates you might need</li>
<li>Install the packages mosquitto and mosquitto-clients that let you run the broker and communicate with it (-y is a flag that automatically says yes to the &quot;do you want to install&quot; prompt)</li>
<li>Register moquitto to automatically start when the system restarts (in case your instance ever goes down)</li>
<li>Start the broker</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.-test-the-broker-locally" tabindex="-1">3. Test the broker locally</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mosquitto_sub -t test &amp;
mosquitto_pub -t test -m &quot;Hello friend&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of code block:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribe to the (-t) topic &quot;test&quot; (&amp; runs this command in the background so you can keep running other commands while this one listens)</li>
<li>Publish to the topic &quot;test&quot; the (-m) message &quot;Hello friend&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see the string &quot;Hello Friend&quot; appear in your EC2 terminal.</p>
<h3 id="4.-test-the-broker-remotely" tabindex="-1">4. Test the broker remotely</h3>
<p>Open a terminal window on your computer and run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mosquitto_pub -h your-ec2-ip -t test -m &quot;Hello from my computer&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the string &quot;Hello from my computer&quot; in your EC2 terminal.</p>
<h2 id="congrats!" tabindex="-1">Congrats!</h2>
<p>Now you have a remote MQTT broker that you can publish/subscribe to with just an internet connection!</p>
<p>I'd highly recommend <a href="ryanjoyce.me">adding a username and password to your broker</a> so that the bad people don't find and spam it. But take a moment and send a few messages, this is really sick.</p>
