## Definitions are subjective

If I tried to define myself, even if I did a very good job, it wouldn't really translate. I think the point of this website is to give you enough data to get a decent idea of who I am.

## Timeline

## Now (Spring 2025)

I am pulling away from Universal Part Finder (my company), looking to experience work as part of a larger team again. I am still enjoying playing sports, though most of my physical activity is takes place working out in the mornings with my friends or in a run club. I am reading a lot, generally sci-fi or philosophy.
