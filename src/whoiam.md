## Now (Spring 2025)

I am pulling away from Universal Part Finder (my company), looking to experience work as part of a larger team again. I am still enjoying playing sports, though most of my physical activity is takes place working out in the mornings with my friends or in a run club. I am reading a lot, generally sci-fi or philosophy.
